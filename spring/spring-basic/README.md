# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers write scalable, maintainable, and robust code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and aim to improve the structure and clarity of software. Below is an overview of each principle:

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This helps to ensure that classes are focused, making the codebase easier to understand and modify.

- **Example**: If a class is responsible for handling both user data and logging, it should be split into two classes: one for user data and one for logging.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without altering its existing source code.

- **Example**: Use interfaces or abstract classes to allow new functionality to be added without modifying existing code.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program. Subclasses should fulfill the expectations of the base class.

- **Example**: If a program expects an object of type Animal, it should work with an instance of a Dog or a Cat without errors.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead of one large interface, it's better to create smaller, more specific interfaces.

- **Example**: Instead of a single `Machine` interface that includes `print()`, `scan()`, and `fax()` methods, create separate interfaces like `Printer`, `Scanner`, and `FaxMachine`.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle helps to reduce the coupling between components, making the code more flexible and easier to refactor.

- **Example**: Rather than a class depending on a concrete database implementation, it should depend on an interface, allowing different database implementations to be injected as needed.

## Summary

The SOLID principles encourage best practices for object-oriented programming, focusing on reducing dependency and increasing flexibility. Following these principles can lead to cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.
